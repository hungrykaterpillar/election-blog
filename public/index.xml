      <description>#Updated Model When predicting the 2022 midterm elections, I decided to create a linear regression model based on variables from 3 categories: 1) expert predictions, 2) economic indicators, and 3) demographic variables. Included in expert predictions are three variables that are coded as dummy variables: whether it is a close election or not, whether voters are Lean, Likely, or Safe Democrats, and whether or not the President is a Democrat or not.</description>

      <description>##How can advertisements be used to predict a candidate’s performance? Reviewing GPR: The gross rating point (GRP) as a general measure of the audience size reached by targeted political advertisements during a specific time frame helps to measure the impact of political ads.

      <description>##Can we trust expert predictions?
This first map visualizes Democratic voteshare at the district level in 2018, based on the Democrat vote share percentage. The map holds many districts that are blue and those that lean towards Democrats. There seems to be a larger voteshare for Democrats (which is in their favor) at the district level. The districts which voted red during the 2014 midterms (California’s 4th district, Washington’s 4th district, and Texas’s 11th district) all had visibly increased Democrat voteshare.</description>

      <description>##Describing Trends in the Popular Vote In this first blog, I will attempt to answer two questions: 1) How competitive are midterm elections in the U.S.? and 2) Which states vote blue/red and how consistently? Based on all midterm elections from 1950 to 2018, I will use visualizations to address these questions.
In the Decline of Competition and Change in Congressional Elections in Congress Responds to the Twentieth Century, Professors Campbell and Juerk claim that without competition, elections are meaningless.</description>
