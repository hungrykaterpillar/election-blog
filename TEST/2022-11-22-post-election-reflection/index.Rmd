A recap of model(s) and predictions

The specified prediction model in section (1) is a multivariate regression model that estimates the popular vote share of Democratic Party for House Representative elections using the past five House Representative election results from 2012 to 2020. The unit of observation is congressional districts in the U.S. Not all the variables are available for the 2012-2022 study period, so the total number of sample observations used to specify the multivariate regression model is 488. This is mainly due to the availability of raw data about expert rating from ‚ÄúFiveThirtyEight.‚Äù

The dependent variable is the Democratic Party vote share out of the total votes to two parities (Democratic and Republican). The proposed model has three groups of independent variables: (i) Political Environment captured by how competitive election is and who is in White House; (ii) Macroeconomic Performance in the U.S. represented by Consumer Price Level, and Labor Market situation (unemployment rate); (iii) Demographic Characteristics of Voting Age Population represented by shares of female, young voters in 20s, and white non-Hispanic voters. The coefficients for all variables except for unemployment rate variable show the expected signs and significant at 5% level. (Details are explained in the following sections.) It is important to consider how close the election is when estimating the popular vote share since this can increase the voter turnout rate. Also, President‚Äôs party historically tends to have disadvantages in House elections. National macroeconomic performance can serve as critical factors for voters as well. Demographic characteristics of voters are important to predict the election results, e.g., in an election where majority of voters are more progressive such as younger voters, female, and minority in race, Democratic party‚Äôs popular votes tend to increase. 

According to the FiveThirtyEight prediction of national popular vote for 2022 House Representative election, popular vote margin is in favor of Republican party, ranging from 2.3% on Sep 23, 2022 to 6.6% on June 13. In other words, the margin has never been greater than 20%, indicating that 2022 House Representative election is Toss-up election when measured by popular vote. That is why the value of dummy variables (X1 is set to be one, while X2 is set to be zero).

Y = 27.32918+ 11.89708*X1 + 5.69332*X2 -2.55847*X3 -0.06183*X4 + 0.26367*X5 
      + 57.40102*X6 + 19.91099*X7 ‚Äì 2.43858* X8

whereas,  	Y = Democratic Party Popular Vote Share of two major parties (in %) 
			[100-Y = Republican Popular Vote Share of two major parties (in %)]
		X1 = Dummy for Close (Toss-up) Election 
			if votes for either candidate < 60% (i.e., margin < 20%), 	1
			otherwise, 						0
		X2 = Dummy for Lean, Likely, or Solid for Democratic candidate
			if votes for Democratic candidate > 60%, 			1
			otherwise, 						0
		X3 = Dummy for Democratic President
			if President is Democrat, 					1
			otherwise, 						0
		X4 = US Consumer Price Index (consumer price level of 1982-84 = 100)
		X5 = US Unemployment Rate (annual average, in %)
		X6 = Share of Female Population among Total Voting Age Population 
		X7 = Share of Population (aged 20-29) among Total Voting Age Population
		X8 = Share of White Non-Hispanic Single Race Population among Total 
        Voting Age Population

To make a prediction of nationwide Democratic Party Vote Share of the two major party votes, the proposed multivariate regression model is used. For the 2022 House Representative Election, the most recent data available are used at national level from various data sources. Details are summarized in the table below.

US Popular Vote Prediction

The predicted nationwide Democratic Party vote share of 2022 House Representative Election is 50.56%, whereas the matching share for Republican Party is 49.44% (=100% -50.56%). Consequently, the margin between two major parties is expected to be 1.12%.

Nevada 3rd District Prediction

Additionally, the prediction for the most competitive district in Nevada (NV-3) was made using the proposed model. The demographic characteristics of the district (NV-3) and U.S. macroeconomic conditions with the expert rating for the election are used to estimate the popular vote share of the Democratic candidate. The predicted Democratic candidate (Susie Lee) vote share in NV-3 for the 2022 House Representative Election is 50.47%, whereas the matching share for Republican candidate (Dan Rodimer) is 49.53% (=100% -50.47%). Consequently, the margin between two major parties is expected to be 0.94%.

The prediction interval for NV-3 district is also estimated. The Democratic candidate (Susie Lee) is expected to win with an estimated vote share of 51.40% against the Republican candidate (Dan Rodimer). With 95% of predictive interval, the lower bound of the popular vote share of Democratic candidate is 43.77% and the upper bound is 59.03%.

A description of the accuracy of the model(s) ‚Äì Graphs

The prediction model‚Äôs accuracy can be checked based on the gap between the prediction and the actual election results from 2022 Midterm Election. The model works better with more accurate prediction for a specific congressional district (e.g., Nevada 3rd District) than the US popular vote. 

US Popular Vote Prediction
The predicted popular vote for Democratic Party 		= 50.56%
The actual popular vote for Democratic Party 		= 48.42%
ü°∫ The prediction model overestimates the Democratic popular vote share by 2.14%. But, the 95% prediction interval ranges from 43.02% to 58.10%, which includes the actual popular vote for Democratic Party

Nevada 3rd District Prediction
The predicted popular vote for Democratic Candidate 	= 50.47%
The actual popular vote for Democratic Candidate 		= 51.98%
ü°∫ The prediction model underestimates the popular vote share for Democratic candidate, Susie Lee, by 1.51%. But, the 95% prediction interval ranges from 42.91% to 58.02%, which includes the actual popular vote for Democratic Party
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
In a graph shown above, the slope of best fitted (red) line between ‚ÄòPredicted Values‚Äô on horizontal axis and ‚ÄòObserved Values‚Äô on vertical axis is less than 1. This indicates the prediction model‚Äôs general tendency for overestimation of Democratic popular vote share. When validating the prediction model performance, the calculated RMSE of the model with all sample observations is 3.574183 that shows the average distance between the observed values and the predicted values of Democrat Vote Share (the dependent variable). 

Run the R-code below to show the RMSE value of 3.574183

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Proposed hypotheses for why the model(s) were inaccurate in the estimates or locations where it was inaccurate

Hypothesis 1: 
Null: 		Relative over-representativeness of specific demographic groups does not 
cause the overestimation of US popular vote share for Democratic Party.
Alternative: 	Relative over-representativeness of specific demographic groups does 
cause the overestimation of US popular vote share for Democratic Party.

The second highest coefficient (positive and significant marginal effect) in the prediction model is from ‚ÄúX20_29‚Äù variable (Share of Population (aged 20-29) among Total Voting Age Population). However, this variable does not consider the voting eligibility based on citizenship status, rather the variable includes all the population between 20 years old and 29 years old. Hispanic population are much younger with the median age of 29.8 compared to 38.5 for all Americans (source: https://usafacts.org/articles/demographics-hispanic-americans/). Additionally, 22% of Hispanics are not U.S. citizens (source: https://usafacts.org/articles/demographics-hispanic-americans/). Consequently, the variable might have over-represented the young voters in their 20s that contributed to the overestimation of Democratic popular vote share.
The largest positive and significant marginal effect among the independent variables is from ‚Äúfemale‚Äù variable (Share of Female Population among Total Voting Age Population). Again, not all female population over 18 years old are U.S. citizens and eligible to vote. According to the 2021 ACS (American Community Survey) 1-year Estimates Data, approximately 7.2% of females over 18 years old in the U.S. are not U.S. citizens. 

Hypothesis 2: 
Null: 		Use of scale (continuous), not dummy, variable for expert rating from 
‚ÄúFiveThirtyEight‚Äù does not enhance the model predictability for US popular vote share for Democratic Party.
Alternative: 	Use of scale (continuous), not dummy, variable for expert rating from 
‚ÄúFiveThirtyEight‚Äù does enhance the model predictability for US popular vote share for Democratic Party.

The two political environment variables are created as dummy variables and both have positive and significant marginal effects in the prediction model. The ‚ÄúClose_E_D‚Äù variable is for close (toss-up) election dummy, while ‚ÄúLLS_D‚Äù variable is for lean, likely, or solid for Democrat dummy. At the national level, the popular vote margin between Democrat and Republican rarely exceeds 20%. Therefore, the prediction model always takes the value of 1 for these two dummy variables at national level popular vote share prediction. If scale (continuous), not dummy, variables can be used, the model predictability may improve. 
Proposed quantitative tests that could test these hypotheses

Quantitative Test for Hypotheses 1 
A new multivariate regression model can be specified using a set of new demographic variables considering voter eligibility. 
Compare RMSE of the original model to that of the new model to determine the better performing model. A model with a lower RMSE predicts better. Other measures such as R-square for the overall model performance can be used to test if a model has lower error (or less likely to overestimate). 
The Diebold-Mariano (DM) test can be used to compare predictive accuracy of the original and the new models. 
Quantitative Test for Hypotheses 12
A new multivariate regression model can be specified using a set of the new and refined scale (not dummy) variables of expert rating data. 
Compare RMSE of the original model to that of the new model to determine the better performing model. A model with a lower RMSE predicts better. Other measures such as R-square for the overall model performance can be used to test if a model has lower error (or less likely to overestimate). 
The Diebold-Mariano (DM) test can be used to compare predictive accuracy of the original and the new models.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
A description of how I might change the model if I were to do it again

I may improve the predictive power of the proposed model by employing a new set of data for model specification. The newly specified model will yield a new set of coefficients (marginal effects) for estimating the Democrat popular vote share. 
For demographic variables, I would use the ACS 1-year estimate dataset that enables the crosstabulation of race and gender with citizenship status. This is available at Congressional District Level. The denominator for calculating the share of specific demographic group is no longer voting-age population; rather it will eligible voters with citizenship. By doing this, over-representation of specific demographic groups such as voters in 20s can be controlled. Accordingly, the related overestimation problems of US popular vote share for Democratic party can be corrected. This will contribute to the enhanced model predictability. 
For expert rating variables, average rating that ranges from 1 (solid Democrat) to 7 (solid Republican) can be rescaled using an average percentage of poll data. This will be a better use of popular polling data at congressional district level. The newly revised model with this average percentage of poll data will produce higher accuracy, indicating the enhanced predictability of model.
